# ChE-411: Project

## Introduction

This project aims to reproduce results from the paper **"A detailed genome-scale metabolic model of _Clostridium thermocellum_ investigates sources of pyrophosphate for driving glycolysis"**. The metabolic model of _C. thermocellum_ used in the study, known as iCTH669, is publicly available through the [Maranas Group's GitHub repository](https://github.com/maranasgroup/iCTH669).

The primary focus of this project is to explore how pyrophosphate (PPi) can be a driving force for glycolysis in _C. thermocellum_ by simulating the model using the provided dataset. This work includes validating model predictions and exploring additional metabolic features of _C. thermocellum_.

## Tasks (Updated Every Thursday)

### Week 1 (October 16th, 2024)
- [ ] Clone and explore the iCTH669 repository.
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (COBRApy, etc.).
- [ ] Reproduce basic simulations using the data provided.
  
### Week 2 (October 23rd, 2024)
- [ ] Analyze glycolytic pathway fluxes.
- [ ] Compare the model outputs with experimental data from the paper.
- [ ] Identify possible points of deviation.

### Week 3 (October 30th, 2024)
- [ ] Investigate sources of pyrophosphate in the metabolic network.
- [ ] Propose hypotheses based on simulation outcomes.

Additional tasks will be added each week based on progress and new insights.
